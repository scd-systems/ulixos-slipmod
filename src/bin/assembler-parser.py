"""
This Parser replaces Code of the following form:

asm {
  starta: mov eax, 0x1001   // comment
  mov ebx, 'A'              // more comment
  int 0x80
}

with code that looks like this:

asm ("\
  .intel_syntax noprefix; \
  starta: mov eax, 0x1001; \
  mov ebx, 'A'; \
  int 0x80; \
  .att_syntax; \
");

It also understands  asm volatile.

What it cannot cope with is variable / register usage.

Note that it does not change the number or position
of code lines.
